# Project-2---Data-Science
A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per-capita income. It is extremely useful for analyzing statistical data spatially. The data variable uses color progression to represent itself in each region of the map. 

This first part of the project aims to analyze Brazil's population density, especially in the northeast area. Choropleth maps were used in order to obtain better data representation.  

The second part of the project aims to analyze uber requests distribution inside Natal ( a city located in Rio Grande do Norte - Brazil) by using choropleth maps. The analysis was based on the time to get an Uber ride in a specific neighborhood of Natal. The main propose was to analyze the waiting time experienced by the client to have an Uber car available to them.

# Objectives 
The main objective of this part of the project is comprehend how choropleth maps are useful to analyze statistical data. Additionally, the results obtained from the analysis supports the idea that population density is higher on capitals than other regions. In general, people used to live near to city centers. 

# Results and Conclusion Part A
As expected, the results obtained from the map show that in general Capitals present expressive population density in comparison to other regions. The choropleth map showed the population density differences between all counties of  Brazil's northeast region using colors pattern. Salvador, Capital of Bahia, it is the county with higher population density. And the county of Miguel Leão presents the lowest population density. The results were coherent to theory.
**Observation:** Before running the code presented in this part of the project it is necessary to execute the following code to avoid the error \"IOPub data rate exceeded\"
"jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=10000000000\n",

# Results and Conclusion Part B
This project used Uber API and choropleth maps to analyze the distribution of Uber products (UberX and UberSelect) in Natal. The analysis lasted one week and basically, the methodology was based on collecting the waiting time estimative for each neighborhood of the city. In other words, the interest was to verify the waiting time to get an Uber ride from each part of the city during the day. 
The results were quite interesting. Comparing the two maps generated using choropleth for UberX and UberSelect is clear that the north region of the city, which represents the socially and economically less developed area, it had the highest waiting time. This shows how this kind of service is associated to social questions. 
Choropleth maps showed to be an useful tool to study and analyse statistical data spatially. It promotes a clear comprehend regarding a distribution. 
As a suggestion to further projects, these results could be compared to economic data in order to evidence how social segregation influences the fair access to technology.
