# Project-2---Data-Science
A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per-capita income. It is extremely useful for analyzing statistical data spatially. The data variable uses color progression to represent itself in each region of the map. This first part of the project aims to analyze Brazil's population density, especially in the northeast area. Choropleth maps were used in order to obtain better data representation.  The second part of the project aims to analyze uber requests distribution inside Natal ( a city located in Rio Grande do Norte - Brazil) by using choropleth maps. The analysis was based on the time to get an Uber ride in a specific neighborhood of Natal. The main propose was to analyze the waiting time experienced by the client to have an Uber car available to them.
